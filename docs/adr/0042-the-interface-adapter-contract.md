# 42. The interface adapter contract

- Status: Proposed
- Date: 2026-07-22

## Context

The request pipeline now runs inside `orchestration`. `LearningLoop.respond`
takes an utterance through intent → context → retrieval → planning; `StepRunner`
takes a single planned step through selection → permission → execution, parking
on a `CONFIRM` and continuing through `resume`; `StepExecutor` performs the one
authorised call. What does *not* yet exist is a way for a human to drive any of
it. `interfaces/` is a ~50-line stub: `cli.py` wires a `typer` app with one
`version` command and a docstring promising it "calls into the (not-yet-built)
orchestration engine." The engine is now built; the adapter is not.

Before the first real adapter is written, four things are undecided, and writing
the adapter first would decide them by accident:

- **The seam.** What does an interface depend on to drive the engine? The
  architecture map calls `interfaces/` "thin adapters onto the engine," and
  golden rule 1 routes cross-*subsystem* traffic through the Protocols in
  `core/protocols.py`. But every Protocol there is a capability the engine
  *consumes* (`MemoryStore`, `Planner`, `ActionPolicy`, …), injected into it.
  Nothing describes the surface the engine *offers* a caller. `lint-imports`
  encodes the asymmetry deliberately: its "subsystems do not import orchestration
  or interfaces" contract names only the seven subsystems as sources —
  `interfaces` is not one of them, and `orchestration` is not a forbidden target
  for it. An adapter importing the concrete engine is permitted by the boundary
  rules as they stand; it is the engine's driver, not a peer subsystem talking to
  another subsystem across a contract.

- **The composition root.** The engine classes import nothing concrete — "Every
  collaborator arrives by injection" (`loop.py`) — and ADR-0022 §1 makes that
  binding, not incidental: "`orchestration` may import no concrete subsystem…
  It receives implementations by injection and sees them only through `core`
  Protocols." So the wiring that constructs `SqliteMemoryStore`, a planner, the
  tool registry, the policy and the audit trail and injects them **cannot live in
  `orchestration`**. Yet that wiring must honour obligations no type can express —
  the `MemoryWriter` must persist to the same store the loop retrieves from
  (ADR-0028 §4), and one object must be injected as both the `ToolRegistry` that
  selects and the `ToolInvoker` that acts (ADR-0029 §8) — so it also must not be
  copied into every front end, where each copy is a place those security-critical
  invariants can go wrong. Where the one composition root lives is a decision.

- **How a request enters and a response leaves.** The engine parks on
  `AWAITING_CONFIRMATION` (`Disposition.AWAITING_CONFIRMATION`), and the human
  answer that releases it must come back through the boundary. The rule for who
  *authors* that answer is already set — `ActionPolicy.resolve`'s own docstring
  says leaving the yes/no-to-ruling conversion "to the caller would put the
  authoring of a permission outcome in `orchestration` or, worse, in an interface
  adapter — the business logic golden rule 3 keeps out of `interfaces/`." So the
  boundary must *transport* consent without *authoring* a ruling — and it must
  render a prompt a human can actually judge, which the stage-level
  `StepDisposition` (only `state`, `decision_id`, `tool_id`) does not by itself
  carry. The shape of that round trip needs deciding before an adapter invents one.

- **Whether this needs a new contract.** A new engine-facing Protocol in
  `core/protocols.py`, or a new `core/types.py` boundary type, would be a
  contract change under golden rule 5 — ratified and merged ahead of any
  implementation, its triad a separate lane. Whether one is warranted, or whether
  the existing surface suffices, is the load-bearing decision here.

This ADR decides the contract so the first adapter — a CLI — is built against a
ratified seam rather than inventing one. It decides no code; the façade, the
composition root and the CLI are a later implementation lane.

## Decision

### 1. The seam is a concrete `orchestration` façade, not a new Protocol

An interface adapter depends on a single **engine façade** that `orchestration`
exposes as a concrete class, plus the result DTOs that façade returns. It does
**not** depend on any subsystem, and it does **not** depend on the engine's
internal stage objects (`LearningLoop`, `StepRunner`, `StepExecutor`) directly —
those become collaborators the façade composes, addressable to the adapter only
through the façade's own methods.

**We will not add an engine-facing Protocol to `core/protocols.py`, and we will
not add a new `core/types.py` type.** This ADR is therefore **not a contract
change** to the `core` surface: its floor paths (`core/protocols.py`,
`core/types.py`) are untouched, and its follow-up implementation is an ordinary
`orchestration` + `interfaces` lane, **not a Protocol triad**.

The reasoning:

- **The engine is not a peer subsystem.** Golden rule 1 exists so two
  *subsystems* — independently replaceable, each unaware of the others — meet
  only through a contract. The adapter → engine edge is not that shape: there is
  exactly one orchestration engine, the adapter exists solely to drive it, and
  `lint-imports` already permits the import. A Protocol between them would model a
  substitutability that does not exist.

- **A Protocol here would cost a triad for no payoff.** A new Protocol is not a
  free annotation: it obliges a shared conformance suite and a canonical fake in
  `ai_assistant.testing`, landing together (`CONTRIBUTING.md` → "Adding a
  Protocol"). That machinery earns its cost when many implementations must be held
  to one contract. The engine has one implementation and one class of consumer;
  the suite would encode a contract nothing else ever satisfies.

- **The façade's result type stays out of `core`.** The façade returns its own
  **`orchestration`-level** result type — a frozen dataclass in `orchestration`,
  like `TurnResult` and `StepDisposition`, each documented as crossing "no
  *subsystem* boundary: only `interfaces`, which already depends on this package,
  ever sees one." It may carry *more* than the raw stage DTOs expose (§4), but it
  is still not a `core` type: promotion to `core` is reserved for "the day a
  subsystem needs to receive one," which this is not.

**Revisit trigger.** If a *second* engine implementation is ever genuinely needed
— a remote engine, a degraded offline engine — the façade is promoted to a
Protocol *then*, contract-first: its ADR and triad land before the second
implementation. Introducing the Protocol now would be blessing a seam with no
second implementation to prove it, the exact failure `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s
spike-first guidance warns against.

### 2. The composition root is a shared builder in `interfaces`, not in `orchestration`

The wiring that constructs concrete subsystems and injects them into the engine
lives in a **single shared composition-root module in `interfaces`** — a
`build_engine(settings)` factory (name illustrative) that returns a façade ready
to drive. This is the classic composition root: the one place, at the outermost
layer of the application, where concrete implementations are named and assembled.

It goes in `interfaces` and **not** in `orchestration` because ADR-0022 §1 binds
`orchestration` to import no concrete subsystem — a property that ADR calls "the
one being tested," not a preference. `interfaces` is the layer both ADR-0022 §1
and `lint-imports` permit to touch implementations (the "subsystems do not import
orchestration or interfaces" contract names `interfaces` only as a *target*, never
a forbidden source). The composition root is therefore the **one part of
`interfaces` exempt from "thin"** — composition is not business logic, and every
application has exactly one composition root — and it is deliberately a *shared*
module distinct from the adapters, so the wiring obligations that no type can
express are discharged **once**:

- the same `MemoryStore` instance is passed to the loop and to the `MemoryWriter`
  (ADR-0028 §4);
- one object is injected as both the selecting `ToolRegistry` and the acting
  `ToolInvoker` (ADR-0029 §8).

Every adapter (the CLI now, an API later) obtains its engine from this one
builder and does no construction or injection itself (§6). Sharing the builder is
what keeps those security-critical invariants in a single audited place rather
than re-implemented per front end, and keeps each adapter thin.

The builder can only wire a subsystem that *has* a production implementation.
Where one does not yet exist — today the `Planner` has only
`ai_assistant.testing.FakePlanner`, which production code may not import — that
production implementation is a **prerequisite lane** the builder-backed CLI
depends on, named in Consequences rather than assumed here.

### 3. A request enters as one call; a response leaves as one result

The façade's human-facing surface is **request/response**: the adapter hands the
engine one unit of input and receives one result describing what happened. Two
call shapes, mirroring the two the engine already has:

- **A turn.** `converse(utterance: str) -> <TurnOutcome>` (names illustrative):
  the adapter passes the user's raw utterance — unrewritten; intent is the
  engine's, not the adapter's — and receives an `orchestration`-level result (§1)
  carrying the answer/plan, whether retrieval degraded
  (`TurnResult.memory_degraded`, which the adapter is obliged to surface, not
  swallow), and the disposition of any step the engine drove — including a parked
  confirmation (§4).

- **A resumption.** When a step parks, the adapter later calls
  `resume(<token>, approved: bool) -> <TurnOutcome>` to release or refuse it (§4).

### 4. A confirmation is a prompt the adapter transports, not a decision it makes

When the engine parks a step (`Disposition.AWAITING_CONFIRMATION`), the façade
result it returns must carry two things — and because the adapter is forbidden
from reading the registry, the audit trail, or a `PermissionDecision` (§6), the
*engine* is what assembles them into the result:

- **Display-safe confirmation content** — enough for a person to judge the action:
  the selected tool's human-readable name/description and the parameters it would
  run with, rendered safe by the engine. The stage-level `StepDisposition` carries
  only `tool_id`, which is not enough for a human to confirm "send email to X"; so
  the façade's confirmation outcome is a **richer `orchestration`-level DTO** (§1)
  that the implementation lane defines to hold this content. This is the concrete
  reason §3's result type is the façade's own, not a raw stage DTO.

- **An opaque continuation token** — everything the engine needs to resume the
  exact parked step and no more. Today that is the recorded `CONFIRM`'s
  `decision_id` (carried on `StepDisposition` "until #242 lands") together with
  the step and execution identity `resume` authenticates against
  (`StepRunner._check_parked`). The adapter treats the token as opaque: it stores
  it, relays it back on `resume`, and **never interprets, constructs, or
  re-derives its contents.**

The adapter renders the display content, collects the human's yes/no (I/O), maps
the keypress to `approved: bool` (adaptation), and calls `resume(token,
approved=…)`. It does **not** author the permission outcome.
`ActionPolicy.resolve` — inside `permissions`, reached through the engine — is
what turns `approved` into an `ALLOW` or `DENY` ruling, and only
`approved=False → DENY` is guaranteed; `approved=True` may still be refused by the
policy. The adapter conveys consent; the policy rules on it; the engine records
and executes. An adapter that branched on the token's contents to decide
allow/deny itself would be authoring a permission outcome in `interfaces/`,
precisely what §3's cited rule forbids.

### 5. Streaming and progress are request/response in v1, extensible later

The engine today returns a *final* result per call; it exposes no incremental
progress stream, and no streaming contract exists anywhere in `core`. **v1 is
strictly request/response**: the adapter renders the final outcome of each call,
and multi-step progress is surfaced by rendering the resulting state, not by
live-streaming intermediate events.

If token-level streaming or per-step progress is wanted later, it is added as an
**additive** façade method returning an async iterator of progress events (the
engine's methods are already `async`; the system composes on one event loop), and
it composes with — rather than replaces — the request/response entry. Deferring it
keeps v1 honest about what the engine can actually produce and avoids inventing a
progress-event type before there is an engine stage that emits one.

### 6. What "thin" permits and forbids

The rules in this section govern an interface **adapter** (a CLI command, an API
handler). The shared composition root of §2 is the one deliberate exception — it
does the wiring an adapter may not — and is a distinct module, not part of any
adapter.

An adapter (golden rule 3) **may**:

- **I/O**: read argv/stdin/keypresses, write to stdout/stderr, manage the TTY,
  set process exit codes, install logging via `configure_logging`, load
  `Settings`.
- **Adaptation**: parse input into an utterance string; map a yes/no answer to
  `approved: bool`; supply a per-call timeout budget (the *caller's* budget, which
  ADR-0029 §4 explicitly assigns to the caller, not the tool).
- **Formatting/rendering**: render the façade's result, plans, confirmation
  prompts, degraded-memory notices and `AssistantError`s with Rich; choose
  verbosity and colour.
- **Session shape**: run a read-eval loop over successive turns; hold and relay
  the opaque continuation token between park and resume.

An adapter **may not**:

- author a permission ruling (allow/deny/confirm) — that is `ActionPolicy`;
- plan, infer intent, or select a tool — those are engine stages;
- read or write memory, plan state, or the audit trail directly — only through
  the engine;
- construct or inspect a `ToolCall`, a `PermissionDecision`, or the internals of
  the continuation token;
- construct or inject subsystem implementations — that is the composition root's
  job (§2);
- import any subsystem concrete module, or any provider SDK.

The first four forbidden items are business logic. The provider-SDK import is
caught mechanically (`lint-imports`); the *subsystem* imports are not blocked by a
contract today, and the natural mechanical guard — an "adapters do not import
subsystems" `lint-imports` contract — cannot simply forbid `interfaces` →
subsystem, because the composition root legitimately needs it. Enforcing the
adapter/composition-root split mechanically is left as a follow-on issue, not
decided here; until then it is a review concern.

### 7. The first concrete interface is the CLI

The first adapter is the **CLI** (`interfaces/cli.py`, the `assistant` console
script). It is responsible for:

- an entry command (e.g. a one-shot `ask` and/or an interactive session) that
  obtains the façade from the composition root, drives one or more turns, and
  renders each outcome;
- prompting for confirmations and relaying the yes/no via `resume`;
- surfacing degraded memory and errors, and setting a meaningful exit code.

It is **not** responsible for planning, tool selection, permission decisions,
persistence, subsystem construction, or any engine stage — all of which it
reaches only through the façade, or which the composition root does on its behalf.

Because the plan-driving stage across a plan's steps is itself still being
assembled (`loop.py`: `respond` "still ends at the plan"; step orchestration is
"the next slice"), the CLI's reach grows with the engine's: the *contract* it is
built against is fixed by this ADR now, so the adapter does not have to be
rewritten as those stages land.

## Consequences

**Easier.**

- The first adapter is built against a ratified seam: obtain the façade from the
  composition root, render its result, relay the opaque token. No adapter has to
  invent an entry-point shape or a confirmation round trip.
- No `core` contract change, no triad, no ratify-before-implement gate: the
  follow-up is a single `orchestration` + `interfaces` lane.
- Wiring obligations that no type expresses (ADR-0028 §4, ADR-0029 §8) live in one
  audited composition root, not copied into every front end.
- A second front end (HTTP API, TUI) reuses the same façade and composition root;
  only rendering and I/O differ.
- `orchestration` keeps ADR-0022 §1's import-purity: the composition root is in
  `interfaces`, so no concrete subsystem is imported into the engine layer.

**Harder.**

- The builder can only wire subsystems that have a production implementation.
  Some do not yet — the `Planner` is `FakePlanner`-only today — so the
  builder-backed CLI depends on those prerequisite lanes landing first; a
  fully-driving CLI is gated on them, and until then the adapter reaches only as
  far as the real subsystems allow.
- The "adapter must not import a subsystem" rule is review-enforced, not
  mechanical: the composition root's legitimate need to import subsystems means a
  blanket `lint-imports` ban would be wrong, so a careless adapter could reach
  past the façade without failing the gate until a finer contract exists.
- Deferring streaming means the CLI renders final states rather than live
  progress; a long turn shows nothing until it resolves. Acceptable for v1,
  revisited when an engine stage emits progress.

**Revisit if** a second engine implementation is genuinely required (promote the
façade to a Protocol, contract-first — §1's trigger); if the continuation token
needs to outlive a process (it must then become a durable, adapter-opaque handle,
which touches the resume path #242 already concerns); or if request/response
proves too coarse for an interactive interface and streaming graduates from a
deferred extension to a decided one.

**Follow-on.** Open issues for: the production subsystem implementations the
builder needs (starting with a production `Planner`); the composition-root +
façade + CLI implementation lane; a mechanical guard for the
adapter/composition-root split (§6); and the deferred streaming façade method
(§5), to be picked up only when a progress-emitting stage exists.

## Alternatives considered

**A new engine-facing Protocol in `core/protocols.py`.** Model the seam like
every other cross-package edge: an `Engine`/`Assistant` Protocol the adapter
depends on, with a conformance suite and a canonical fake. *Rejected.* It models a
substitutability that does not exist — one engine, one consumer class — and pays
the full triad cost (`CONTRIBUTING.md` → "Adding a Protocol") for it. It also
inverts the meaning of `core/protocols.py`, where every Protocol is a capability
the engine *consumes*; an entry contract is one the engine *provides*, a
different kind of thing. The revisit trigger (§1) keeps this option open for the
day a second implementation actually justifies it, taken up contract-first rather
than speculatively now.

**The composition root lives in `orchestration`.** Give `orchestration` a
`build_engine` factory that imports the concrete subsystems and wires the engine,
so the adapter calls one orchestration entry point for everything. *Rejected.* It
directly contradicts ADR-0022 §1, which binds `orchestration` to import no
concrete subsystem and calls that "the property being tested." The composition
root belongs at the outermost layer permitted to name implementations —
`interfaces` (§2) — not in the layer whose purity is the point.

**The composition root is duplicated per adapter.** Let each adapter wire its own
engine inline. *Rejected.* It copies the security-critical wiring obligations
(ADR-0028 §4, ADR-0029 §8) into every front end — the layer golden rule 3 keeps
logic out of — and makes each adapter not thin. A single shared composition-root
module (§2), distinct from the adapters, discharges them once.

**The adapter answers confirmations itself.** Have the adapter map the human's
yes/no straight to an `ALLOW`/`DENY` and hand the engine a resolved decision.
*Rejected outright.* `ActionPolicy.resolve`'s docstring names this as the failure
to avoid — authoring a permission outcome in `interfaces/`. It would also lose the
policy's right to refuse a stale `approved=True` (a confirmation answered long
after it was asked, or one whose request would now be `DENY`). The adapter
transports consent; the policy authors the ruling (§4).

**Reuse `StepDisposition` unchanged as the confirmation result.** Return the raw
stage DTO and let the adapter render from it. *Rejected.* `StepDisposition` carries
only `state`, `decision_id` and `tool_id` — a bare tool id is not enough for a
human to judge "send email to X", and the adapter may not read the registry or
trail to enrich it (§6). The façade's confirmation outcome must carry
engine-assembled, display-safe content (§4); that is why the result type is the
façade's own `orchestration`-level DTO, not a raw stage DTO.

**Streaming in v1.** Define the entry point as an async iterator of progress
events from the start, so the CLI can show live progress. *Rejected for now.* No
engine stage emits incremental progress today, so the event type would be
designed against nothing — the "seam ratified with no implementation contact"
`CONTRIBUTING.md` warns against. Request/response matches what the engine
produces; streaming is kept as an additive extension (§5) for when a stage emits
progress.

**Expose the stage objects (`LearningLoop`, `StepRunner`) to the adapter
directly, with no façade.** The adapter holds the loop and the runner and
sequences them itself. *Rejected.* Sequencing the stages — running a turn, then
driving each of the plan's steps, parking and resuming on confirmations — *is* the
orchestration the engine owns; doing it in the adapter would pull pipeline logic
into `interfaces/`. A façade keeps the adapter's surface to "one call in, one
result out" and leaves stage sequencing where it belongs.

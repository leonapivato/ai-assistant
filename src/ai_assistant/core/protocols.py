"""The contracts (Protocols) each subsystem implements.

This is the most important file for parallel, agent-driven development. Every
subsystem is defined here as a ``typing.Protocol`` — a structural interface with
no implementation. The `orchestration` engine depends only on these Protocols,
so a concrete implementation of any one subsystem can be written, reviewed,
swapped, or mocked in tests without touching the others.

Guidelines when evolving these contracts:
  * A Protocol change is a breaking change — call it out in review and record
    the decision in ``docs/adr/`` before implementing against it.
  * Prefer adding a new Protocol over widening an existing one.
  * Keep methods ``async`` where they touch I/O (models, memory, tools) so the
    whole system composes on one event loop.

Only two exemplar contracts are defined for now (``ModelProvider`` and
``MemoryStore``). The remaining subsystems declared in the architecture add
their Protocols here as they are designed.

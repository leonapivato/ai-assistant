"""Command-line interface — the first adapter onto the engine (ADR-0042 §7).

Kept intentionally thin (golden rule 3, ADR-0042 §6): it parses input into an
utterance, obtains the façade from the composition root, drives one turn with
``converse``/``resume``, renders the final :class:`~ai_assistant.orchestration.TurnOutcome`
with Rich, relays the **opaque** continuation token on a confirmation, and closes
the façade on exit. It authors no permission ruling, plans nothing, selects no
tool, and touches no subsystem directly — all of that is the engine's, reached
only through the façade (ADR-0042 §6). Registered as the ``assistant`` console
script in ``pyproject.toml``.

v1 renders the *final* state of each call; streaming is deferred (ADR-0042 §5).
